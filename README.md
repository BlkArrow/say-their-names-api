  <h1>Say Their Names ‚úäüèø</h1>
</p>

## Overview

Welcome to the Say Their Names project. Our aim is to build an open-source platform that raises awareness of the injustice and often forgotten names of racial inequality at the hands of law enforcement. We strive to identify and amplify verified organizations to ensure donations are reaching those who can make the most impact with it.

## Contributing

**We heartily welcome any and all contributions that match our engineering standards!**
That being said, this codebase isn't your typical open source project because it's not a library or package with a limited scope‚Äîit's our entire product.
